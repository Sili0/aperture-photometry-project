# Aperture Photometry
Aperture photometry project in astrophysics classes (M1 Astro-CCP). We worked on data obtained with the Iris telescope at the OHP. Everything is wrote in french.

## Data
All the raw data (fites images) used during the project, also containing the conversion to celestial coordinates with [NovaAstrometry](https://nova.astrometry.net/). References files (bias and flat) are also included.

## Graphes
The graphes were obtained by exporting to ASCII files the data from the notebook, then processed with QtiPlot. Both 2D and 3D QtiPlot files are included.

## Notebook
We worked with Jupiter Notebooks for all the coding sections, the detailled, commented notebook is also available. The data must be in the same tree as in the repository for the notebook to work properly. Adapt the "path" sections to your Jupiter configuration.
